2025-11-18 15:28:41,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rpkgq4wllo,Trump's plan for Gaza backed by UN Security Council,"The UN Security Council has voted in favour of a US-drafted resolution that endorses US President Donald Trump's 20-point plan for Gaza.
Included in the plan is the establishment of an International Stabilisation Force (ISF), to which, the US says, multiple unnamed countries have offered to contribute.
The resolution was backed by 13 countries - including the UK, France and Somalia - with none voting against the proposal. Russia and China abstained.
Adopting it was an ""important step in the consolidation of the ceasefire"", a spokesperson for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said. Hamas has rejected the resolution, saying it fails to meet Palestinians' rights and demands.
The Palestinian armed group wrote on Telegram after the resolution passed that the plan ""imposes an international guardianship mechanism on the Gaza Strip, which our people and their factions reject"".
""Assigning the international force with tasks and roles inside the Gaza Strip, including disarming the resistance, strips it of its neutrality, and turns it into a party to the conflict in favour of the occupation,"" it added.
Under the resolution, the ISF will work with Israel and Egypt, along with a newly trained and vetted Palestinian police force, to help secure border areas and ensure the process of permanently disarming non-state armed groups, including Hamas.
Until now, the police there have operated under the authority of Hamas.
Mike Waltz, the US's ambassador to the UN, told the council that the ISF would be ""tasked with securing the area, supporting the demilitarisation of Gaza, dismantling the terrorist infrastructure, removing weapons, and ensuring the safety of Palestinian civilians"".
The Security Council also approved the creation of a transitional governance body called the Board of Peace (BoP), which would supervise governance of a Palestinian technocratic, apolitical committee and oversee the reconstruction of Gaza and the delivery of humanitarian aid.
Financing for reconstruction of Gaza following two years of war would come from a trust fund backed by the World Bank, according to the resolution.
Under the resolution, both the ISF and the BoP would work alongside a Palestinian committee and police force.
Trump called the Security Council vote ""historic"" and said it was a way of ""acknowledging and endorsing"" the BoP, with its final membership to be announced soon. He is expected to chair the board.
""This will go down as one of the biggest approvals in the History of the United Nations, will lead to further Peace all over the World, and is a moment of true Historic proportion!"" he wrote on his Truth Social platform.
Unlike earlier drafts, the resolution references a credible pathway to Palestinian self-determination and statehood. It is language several council members pushed for.
Israel strongly opposes the creation of a Palestinian state - a significant hurdle in the path to future statehood. Key Arab states had pressured drafters of the resolution to include Palestinian self-determination in the text.
The UN secretary general's spokesperson stressed that the resolution needed to ""translate... into concrete and urgently needed steps on the ground"" and lead to ""a political process for the achievement of the two-state solution"".
The US, the Palestinian Authority, and several Arab and Muslim-majority nations including Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey have called for the quick adoption of the resolution.
The Palestinian Authority (PA) said in a statement that the resolution's terms needed to be implemented ""urgently and immediately"".
Russia and China did not exercise the vetoes they possess, but abstained to allow the resolution to pass, largely because the PA and eight other Arab and Muslim nations backed it.
Both Moscow and Beijing criticised the resolution. They said there was little clarity about the key mechanisms' composition, that it did not ensure the participation of the UN, and that it failed to explicitly reiterate a firm commitment to the two-state solution.
The initial phase of the plan - a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas and the handing over of hostages and detainees - came into force on 10 October. Waltz described it as a ""fragile, fragile first step"".
Trump's peace plan in effect suspended the fighting between Israel and Hamas that had raged since Hamas-led gunmen attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage in that attack.
More than 69,483 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli military action in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."

2025-11-18 15:28:13,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20p3x7vr34o,Shelters plea for Gazans as winter rains raise fears of more disease and death,"Aid agencies have reiterated calls for Israel to allow more tents and urgently needed supplies into Gaza after the first heavy winter rainfall, saying more than a quarter of a million families need emergency help with shelters.
""We are going to lose lives this winter. Children, families will perish,"" says Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC).
""It's actually so frustrating that we've now lost so many crucial weeks since the adoption of the Trump peace plan, which said humanitarian aid would flow and the Palestinians would not needlessly continue to suffer.""
With a majority of the population displaced by two-years of a devastating war, most Gazans now live in tents - many of them makeshift.
They have been clearing up after widespread flooding due to a winter storm that began on Friday.
There are fears that diseases could spread as rainwater has mixed with sewage water.
""My children are already sick and look at what happened to our tent,"" said Fatima Hamdona, crying in the rain over the weekend, as she showed a BBC freelance journalist the ankle-deep puddle inside her temporary home in Gaza City.
""We don't have food - the flour got all wet.  We're people who've been destroyed.  Where do we go? There's no shelter for us to go to now.""
The story was the same in the southern city of Khan Younis.
""Our clothes, mattresses and blankets were flooded,"" said Nihad Shabat, as she tried to dry out her possessions there on Monday.
Her family has been sleeping inside a shelter made of sheets and blankets.
""We're worried about getting flooded again. We cannot afford to buy a tent.""
A recent UN report found that across Gaza more than 80% of buildings had been destroyed and 92% in Gaza City.
According to the NRC - which has long led the so-called Shelter Cluster in Gaza, made up of some 20 non-governmental organisations (NGOs) - about 260,000 Palestinian families, or about 1.5 million people, are in need of emergency shelter assistance, lacking the basics to get through winter.
The NGOs say they have been able to get only about 19,000 tents into Gaza since the US-brokered Israel-Hamas ceasefire took effect on 10 October.
They say they have 4,000 pallets of aid - containing non-food items, including tents and bedding - blocked from entering.  Supplies that have been bought are currently stuck in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.
Jan Egeland blames what he calls ""a bureaucratic, military, politicised quagmire"" running ""counter to all humanitarian principles"" for the hold-up.
In March, Israel introduced a new registration process for aid groups working in Gaza, citing security reasons.  It requires that they give lists of their local Palestinian staff.
However, aid groups say that data protection laws in donor countries prevent them from handing over such information.
Many items, including tent poles, are also classed as ""dual-use"" by Israel, meaning they have a military as well as civilian purpose, and their entry is banned or heavily restricted.
Cogat, the Israeli defence body that controls the border crossings, told the BBC that ""over the last few months"" it had coordinated the entry of ""close to 190,000 tents and tarpaulins directly to the residents of the Gaza Strip"".
It said that ""in accordance with the terms of the agreement"" of the ceasefire, it was allowing ""hundreds of trucks carrying food, water, fuel, gas, medicines, medical equipment, tents, and shelter supplies [to] enter the Gaza Strip every day, in coordination with the UN, international organizations, donor countries, and the private sector"".
On Sunday, Cogat wrote on X: ""We call on international organizations to coordinate more tents and tarpaulins and other winter humanitarian responses.""
It said it was working with the new US-led Civil-Military Coordination Center (CMCC) that had been set up in southern Israel and other international partners to plan ""a catered humanitarian response for the upcoming winter"".
International aid groups are hoping that the CMCC - which will oversee implementation of President Trump's 20-point Gaza peace plan - will help ease restrictions on their work.
With a foreign donor conference on reconstruction in the Palestinian territory expected to take place in Egypt soon, they say basic shelter supplies must be allowed to enter while longer-term plans are developed.
""It would not be a good thing if all these nations meet in Cairo to discuss long-term reconstruction for Palestinians in great need if they die before their high-rise buildings can be reconstructed,"" says Mr Egeland, who was previously the UN's Emergency Relief Coordinator.
""They need a tent today, they don't need a promise of a beachfront structure in five years.""
Palestinians have told the BBC that many tents - brought in by international agencies and Gulf donors - have been stolen and are available on the black market in Gaza.
They say that with a small increase in supply, prices have dropped from about $2,700 (2,330 euros; £2,050) before the ceasefire, to around $900-$1,000.
There are pleas for international help to distribute more shelters, more fairly.
""I hope everyone will join with us to end this crisis we're living through,"" says Alaa al-Dirghali in Khan Younis.  ""The tents endured two years under the sun and two years under the rain and they couldn't last this downpour.""
""Until this moment, people are re-erecting these broken tents because they don't have any alternative.  I pray to God that those responsible for handing out tents will give them to those who actually need them.  They're getting stolen and sold to people at a very expensive price.""
In Gaza City, Rami Deif Allah, who was displaced from Beit Hanoun, was drying out soaked mattresses in the weak sunshine, with his elderly mother and children.
He said a relative had given him a waterproof tent but that it was still flooded.
""We evacuated about 11 times and there was no safe place for us so we took shelter in these humble tents but it was all in vain. When the rain came they couldn't protect us,"" he said. ""The water flooded us from above and below.""
Like all Gazans, Rami longs for a permanent dwelling.
""We pray for this war to be fully over, and for everyone to return to their homes,"" he went on.  ""Even if we don't find our houses standing, with our sweat and blood we will rebuild. This situation of living out on the streets is unbearable.""
Correction 18 November 2025: An earlier version of this article mistakenly said NGO said 44,000 pallets of aid were being blocked from entering Gaza. The correct figure is 4,000."
2025-11-18 15:28:42,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq50nvq8znvo,When is the Epstein files vote - and why does Trump now say he wants them released?,"US President Donald Trump has urged Republicans in Congress to vote to release more files relating to Jeffrey Epstein - a sudden reversal in his position after having previously opposed efforts to make the documents public.
Trump had been facing a potential revolt after a growing number of Republicans signalled they would vote in favour of releasing the files despite his opposition.
While the measure is likely to pass in the House of Representatives on Tuesday, it is far from certain that it would pass in the Republican-controlled Senate.
And even if it does pass in the Senate, it remains unclear when the files could be released and whether they would satisfy ardent campaigners.
On Tuesday, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on a measure that would compel the justice department to make publicly available ""in a searchable and downloadable format"" all files pertaining to Epstein within 30 days.
Procedural votes and debates are expected to begin at 10:00EST (15:00GMT) and continue for many hours.
Several victims of Epstein are also expected to spend the day on Capitol Hill, to advocate for the bill's passage and to hold news conferences with reporters.
The releases could, in theory, also include files pertaining to imprisoned Epstein co-conspirator Ghislaine Maxwell, as well as people - including government officials - mentioned in the case. It could also include internal justice department documents.
The vote will come just two days after Trump wrote on Truth Social to encourage Republicans to vote for the measure. In the post, he argued that ""we have nothing to hide"".
The measure is likely to pass. Even before Trump's post, some House Republicans had made clear they were willing to break ranks with the president and House Speaker Mike Johnson to vote in favour.
Should it pass, it still faces an uncertain future in the Senate, which is under no obligation to even pick up the measure.
It remains unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune will do so - but the Republican is under enormous pressure from both sides of the US political spectrum.
He had previously suggested that while he was ""not hearing"" much desire from fellow Republicans to push for the release of the documents, a successful House vote could change that.
""I just hope John Thune will do the right thing,"" Kentucky Republican Representative Thomas Massie told ABC News over the weekend.
Another Republican, Senate Majority Whip John Barrasso, only told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that the Senate will ""take a look"" at the bill if it passes the House.
""We'll see what it says,"" Barrasso said. ""We all want accountability and transparency. But to me, this it not about the truth. It's not about justice.""
""This is about an attempt by the Democrats to make President Trump a lame-duck president,"" he added. ""And I'm not going to aid and abet them in their efforts to do that.""
Only after the Senate passes the bill would it head to President Trump, who has said he would sign it into law.
Speking to reporters on Monday night, he said Republicans had ""nothing to do with Epstein"". ""It's really a Democrat problem,"" he claimed. ""The Democrats were Epstein's friends, all of them.""
Trump went on to argue the Epstein scandal was a ""hoax"" distracting from ""the greatness of what the Republican Party had accomplished over the last period of time"".
There are obstacles to the files being released even if Trump signs the bill.
The text of the document that will go before the House, for example, notes that the attorney general could withhold or redact portions of records that contain personal information that ""would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy"".
""Simply letting anything out could reveal a lot of private information that's not relevant or appropriate for public consumption,"" Jonathan Entin, a constitutional law professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC.
""There may also be some issues about law enforcement techniques that the justice department might not want to be out there in the public domain,"" he added.
The proposed House bill also notes that the justice department can hold back any documents that ""jeapordise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution, provided that such withholding is narrowly tailored and temporary"".
That could potentially lead to delays, given that President Trump said in his post that he would be calling for an investigation into Epstein's alleged links with prominent Democrats, such as Bill Clinton and Larry Summers ""to determine what was going on with them, and him"".
""That's a potential hurdle,"" Prof Entin said. ""If, in fact, this is a serious investigation, presumably the prosecutors will not want everything out there while they're sorting out whether they bring charges.""
Doing so, he added, ""might create some prejudicial publicity about targets of the investigation"" that could ultimately lead to intense litigation if any indictments are brought.
For those who have campaigned for the release of the files, anything short of full disclosure is likely to spark further questions and even outrage.
""I believe the country deserves transparency in these files,"" Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican now in a public row with Trump over the files, told CNN on Sunday.
""I have no idea what's in the files. I can't even guess,"" Greene added. ""But that is the question everyone is asking is - why fight this so hard?"""

""I am deeply ashamed of my actions and recognise the pain they have caused,"" he said in a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner.
Emails released by a House committee last week show Summers, a former US treasury secretary, communicated with Epstein until the day before the Epstein's 2019 arrest for the alleged sex trafficking of minors.
On Tuesday, House members are expected to vote on a measure calling for the release of all Epstein-related files that have yet to be made public.
The measure would then head to the Senate, and require the approval of US President Donald Trump.
Summers served as treasury secretary under former President Bill Clinton and director of the National Economic Council under former President Barack Obama. He was president of Harvard from 2001 to 2006 and is currently a professor there.
He wrote in his statement on Monday: ""I take full responsibility for my misguided decision to continue communicating with Mr Epstein.""
He added that he wanted ""to rebuild trust and repair relationships with the people closest to me"".
""While continuing to fulfil my teaching obligations, I will be stepping back from public commitments as one part of my broader effort,"" Summers wrote.
The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank in Washington where Summers was a senior fellow, also announced on Monday that he was no longer affiliated with the organisation.
Summers is still listed as a member of ChatGPT-maker OpenAI's board, which he joined in 2023 following a failed attempt to oust its chief executive Sam Altman. The BBC has contacted OpenAI and a representative for Summers about whether he will remain a director at the company.
Summers' move comes after the US Department of Justice announced that it would investigate Epstein's ""involvement and relationship"" with former President Bill Clinton, who was also a friend of Epstein, and several other prominent Democrats.
Clinton has strongly denied he had any knowledge of Epstein's crimes.
The department's decision came at the urging of Trump, who also asked for Summers, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman and banks JP Morgan and Chase, to be investigated.
Hoffman is yet to comment. A spokesperson for JPMorgan Chase said the firm regretted ""any association"" it had with Epstein, and added that it ""did not help him commit his heinous acts"".
Trump was also mentioned in the emails, which do not imply any wrongdoing.
""Epstein was a Democrat, and he is the Democrat's problem, not the Republican's problem!"" he wrote on social media.
""They all know about him, don't waste your time with Trump. I have a Country to run!""
The emails released by the House Oversight Committee last week indicate that Summers and Epstein met for dinner frequently, with Epstein often trying to connect Summers to prominent global figures. At one point, in July 2018, Epstein proposed a meeting with the ""president [sic] of united nations, interesting person for you"".
In a separate email just after Trump's first election in 2016, Summers told Epstein to ""spend zero effort on anything about me with Trump"".
Due to Trump's ""approach to conflict of interest"", Putin ""proximity"" and ""mindless response"" to Cuban leader Fidel Castro's death, Summers said he was ""best off a million miles away"".
A representative for Summers previously told US media that he ""deeply regrets being in contact with Epstein"" after Epstein's conviction in 2008 for soliciting prostitution from a minor.
The emails mention many high-profile figures. A review by the Wall Street Journal found Trump was mentioned in more than 1,600 of the 2,324 email threads.
Trump has repeatedly said he severed contact with the financier years before Epstein was convicted in 2008, and was unaware of his criminal activity. He has consistently denied any wrongdoing in relation to Epstein.
While Trump was discussed in some of the messages released last week, he did not send or receive them."

2025-11-18 15:28:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2emzjre62o,"UK net migration 20% lower in 2024 than first thought, ONS says","Net migration to the UK last year was 20% lower than previously thought, according to revised figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
The number, the difference between those entering and leaving the country, has been revised down by 86,000 people and now stands at 345,000 in 2024.
The driving factor behind the change is that more British nationals are thought to have emigrated in 2024 than initially recorded, with 100,000 fewer now thought to be living in the UK.
Migration peaked higher than previously thought, according to the figures, adding 944,000 to the UK population between April 2022 and March 2023. Previous estimates put the number at 906,000 by June 2023.
The new figures make little change to the overall estimate of net migration to the UK between 2021 and 2024, falling slightly from 2.6 million people to 2.5 million in the revised report.
It comes after the government announced new proposals aimed at reforming the asylum system, which include periodic reviews of asylum status and limitations of migrants' rights to claim benefits.

The ONS have been rebuilding the system used to produce official estimates of migration since 2020. Before the pandemic, statisticians asked a small number of passengers at airports and ports about their travel plans and used those responses to work out how many arrivals might be coming to stay.
But the results obtained by this method were ""implausibly low"" for British nationals, according to Dr Madeleine Sumption, director of the Migration Observatory think tank.
Officials at the ONS said the new figures are based on how often people appear in tax and benefits records, providing a more accurate and active reflection of migrants activities in the UK.
Based on that method, the ONS now thinks that 257,000 British nationals left the UK in 2024 while 143,000 Britons living abroad returned. That means net emigration of Britons - the difference between departures and arrivals - is 114,000 people, rather than its initial estimate of 17,000.
Dr Sumption warns that these figures are ""still not final"" because they don't measure when someone enters or leaves the country. That can cause problems if someone stays in the country but disappears from tax and welfare data because they're living on savings.
Using that method such a person would usually be counted as an emigrant, skewing migration figures. The ONS has stopped using this method to measure EU migration, instead of using visas and border data shared by the Home Office.
Data obtained under the old system estimated that there were 96,000 fewer EU citizens in the UK by the end of 2024, but the new system has revised that estimate downwards to 69,000.
Critics have largely attributed the recent increase to changes brought in under Boris Johnson's government from 2021.
The three main factors have been identified as an increase in work visas - particularly in health and social care - an increase in student visas, and the opening of humanitarian routes for people from Ukraine, Hong Kong and Afghanistan.
Small boat crossings have also been rising in that time. So far this year, 39,075 people have crossed the Channel.
Both Conservative and Labour governments have sought to tackle the rising migration figures. Former Prime Minister Rishi Sunak announced restrictions on the rights of students and care workers to bring their families to the UK.
On Monday, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood announced sweeping changes to the asylum system, which she said was ""out of control and unfair"".

2025-11-18 15:28:45,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8drzv37z4jo,"Don't blindly trust what AI tells you, says Google's Sundar Pichai","People should not ""blindly trust"" everything AI tools tell them, the boss of Google's parent company Alphabet has told the BBC.
In an exclusive interview, chief executive Sundar Pichai said that AI models are ""prone to errors"" and urged people to use them alongside other tools.
Mr Pichai said it highlighted the importance of having a rich information ecosystem, rather than solely relying on AI technology.
""This is why people also use Google search, and we have other products that are more grounded in providing accurate information.""
However, some experts say big tech firms such as Google should not be inviting users to fact-check their tools' output, but should focus instead on making their systems more reliable.
While AI tools were helpful ""if you want to creatively write something"", Mr Pichai said people ""have to learn to use these tools for what they're good at, and not blindly trust everything they say"".
He told the BBC: ""We take pride in the amount of work we put in to give us as accurate information as possible, but the current state-of-the-art AI technology is prone to some errors.""
The company displays disclaimers on its AI tools to let users know they can make mistakes.
But this has not shielded it from criticism and concerns over errors made by its own products.
Google's rollout of AI Overviews summarising its search results was marred by criticism and mockery over some erratic, inaccurate responses.
The tendency for generative AI products, such as chatbots, to relay misleading or false information, is a cause of concern among experts.
""We know these systems make up answers, and they make up answers to please us - and that's a problem,"" Gina Neff, professor of responsible AI at Queen Mary University of London, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.
""It's okay if I'm asking 'what movie should I see next', it's quite different if I'm asking really sensitive questions about my health, mental wellbeing, about science, about news,"" she said.
She also urged Google to take more responsibility over its AI products and their accuracy, rather than passing that on to consumers.
""The company now is asking to mark their own exam paper while they're burning down the school,"" the said.
The tech world has been awaiting the latest launch of Google's consumer AI model, Gemini 3.0, which is starting to win back market share from ChatGPT.
From May this year, Google began introducing a new ""AI Mode"" into its search, integrating its Gemini chatbot which is aimed at giving users the experience of talking to an expert.
At the time, Mr Pichai said the integration of Gemini with search signalled a ""new phase of the AI platform shift"".
The move is also part of the tech giant's bid to remain competitive against AI services such as ChatGPT, which have threatened Google's online search dominance.
His comments back up BBC research from earlier this year, which found that AI chatbots inaccurately summarised news stories.
OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Copilot, Google's Gemini and Perplexity AI were all given content from the BBC website and asked questions about it, and the research found the AI answers contained ""significant inaccuracies"".
In his interview with the BBC, Mr Pichai said there was some tension between how fast technology was being developed and how mitigations are built in to prevent potential harmful effects.
For Alphabet, Mr Pichai said managing that tension means being ""bold and responsible at the same time"".
""So we are moving fast through this moment. I think our consumers are demanding it,"" he said.
The tech giant has also increased its investment in AI security in proportion with its investment in AI, Mr Pichai added.
""For example, we are open-sourcing technology which will allow you to detect whether an image is generated by AI,"" he said.
Asked about recently uncovered years-old comments from tech billionaire Elon Musk to OpenAI's founders around fears the now Google-owned DeepMind could create an AI ""dictatorship"", Mr Pichai said ""no one company should own a technology as powerful as AI"".
But he added there were many companies in the AI ecosystem today.
""If there was only one company which was building AI technology and everyone else had to use it, I would be concerned about that too, but we are so far from that scenario right now,"" he said."

2025-11-18 15:28:26,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3dgkx419qo,South Africa to refuse charter flights of Palestinians over fears of 'cleansing agenda',"South Africa has said it does not want to receive any more chartered flights carrying Palestinians, days after the controversial arrival of 153 passengers from Gaza in the country.
Many aspects of their arrival remain unclear and disputed.
The flight was part of ""a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians out of Gaza and the West Bank"", Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola said on Monday.
The Israeli authorities have not responded to this allegation. However, they said that South Africa had previously agreed to receive the 153 Palestinians.
The BBC has asked the South African authorities to comment.
The Palestinian embassy in South Africa has said the group left Israel's Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, ""without any prior note or coordination"".
It said that ""an unregistered and misleading organization"" had exploited the plight of the Gaza citizens, ""deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner"".
The Palestinian foreign ministry went on to say, through the embassy, that it was working with South Africa to ""address this situation resulting from this lapse"".
The flight at the centre of the dispute arrived on Thursday, at South Africa's OR Tambo International Airport.
The passengers were initially refused entry into the country and were stuck on the plane for more than 10 hours.
Authorities in South Africa, which has strongly supported the Palestinian cause during the war in Gaza between Israel and Hamas, said this was because the passengers did not have departure stamps in their passports. Palestinians are allowed to travel to South Africa for 90 days without a visa.
Eventually, the group was allowed to disembark after intervention from a local charity. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said this was out of ""empathy [and] compassion"". Twenty-three of the passengers had already taken flights elsewhere so 130 were allowed into the country, South African authorities said.
During a media briefing about South Africa's readiness to host the G20 Leaders' Summit, taking place this weekend, Lamola said Thursday's flight looked like it was part of a ""broader agenda to remove Palestinians from Palestine into many different parts of the world"".
""[This] is a clearly orchestrated operation because they are not only being sent to South Africa. There are other countries where such flights have been sent,"" he said, without giving any details. He added that the matter was being investigated.
Two weeks ago, another plane carrying 176 Palestinians landed in Johannesburg, with some of the passengers proceeding to other countries, according to the local Gift of the Givers charity that is assisting the arrivals.
Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has repeatedly spoken about resettling Palestinians from Gaza ""voluntarily"" - a move that has been criticised by Palestinians, human rights groups and many in the international community.
Speaking a day after the flight arrived, South Africa's president said the Palestinians ""somehow mysteriously were put on a plane that passed by Nairobi"" and flew to South Africa, according to local online publication News24.
Israeli military body Cogat, which controls Gaza's crossings, said in a statement: ""The residents left the Gaza Strip after Cogat received approval from a third country to receive them."" It did not specify the country at the time.
Cogat on Monday named South Africa as the third country that had agreed to receive the Palestinians.
South Africa has been highly critical of Israel's military operation in Gaza.
The country's sympathy for the Palestinian fight for an independent state goes back decades, particularly the early 1990s when anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandela pledged support for the Palestinian cause.
Large pro-Palestinian marches have been held around South Africa since the conflict began.
Smaller pro-Israel marches and rallies have been held in the country, which hosts the largest Jewish community in sub-Saharan Africa.
In 2023, the South African government filed a case against Israel with the International Court of Justice, accusing it of genocide in Gaza. Israel has strongly rejected the South African claim, calling it ""baseless"".

""We will be doing that. We will be selling F-35 jets,"" Trump said. ""They've been a great ally.""
The leaders are expected to discuss deals on defence and civilian nuclear power during Tuesday's White House visit, the first by the de facto Saudi leader since journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed and dismembered at the hands of Saudi agents seven years ago.
A US intelligence assessment said Prince Mohammed approved the operation that led to the killing. The crown prince denied any role in the murder.
Prince Mohammed's last visit was during Trump's first term in 2018, the same year as Khashoggi's murder in Istanbul.
While former President Joe Biden did not host the crown prince and promised to make the country a ""pariah"" over its human rights record, Biden did visit Saudi Arabia in 2022 to reach agreements on other issues. Biden said he raised Khashoggi's murder in that meeting.
Trump and the crown prince already met in Riyadh in May. There, the US agreed to sell nearly $142bn (£107bn) worth of arms to Saudi Arabia  in what the White House described as the ""largest defence sales agreement in history"", as part of a $600bn investment deal. Saudia Arabia is the largest buyer of US arms.
Some American defence officials have raised concerns about a potential sale of F-35s, considered the most advanced fighter jet in the world, to Saudi Arabia. They told US media that they feared it would give Saudi Arabia access to sensitive stealth technology, which the country could then share with China under a security partnership between the two powers.
Officials in Israel are also worried, telling US and local media that a deal has the potential to hurt the country's military standing. Israel is the closest US ally in the Middle East and the only country in the region with F-35s.
One F-35A jet costs on average $82.5m, according to lead manufacturer Lockheed Martin.
During Tuesday's meeting, Trump is also expected to push for Saudi Arabia to sign the Abraham Accords he created and normalise relations with Israel. The Saudis have said that is conditional on a path to a Palestinian state - which the current Israeli government rejects."

In September, Eminem – whose real name is Marshall B Mathers III – filed a petition to the US Patent and Trademark Office, calling for it to cancel a trademark that was granted to the company. US law requires the company to respond to the petition by next week.
The 53-year-old rapper's lawyers accused the Sydney-based brand of creating a ""false association"" with Eminem.
Swim Shady told the BBC in a statement that it would ""defend our valuable intellectual property"".
The company's name was registered in September 2023, according to Australia's business regulator, having originally launching under the name Slim Shade. It officially launched in 2024.
The brand sells portable beach umbrellas, swim bags and other beach accessories.
Earlier this year, the brand filed a trademark in the US for the term ""Swim Shady"", which was granted. Shortly afterwards, Eminem's team filed a petition to cancel the trademark.
Eminem has also filed an opposition to the brand's name in Australia.
""Swim Shady is a grass roots Australian company that was born out of a desire to produce stylish and effective sun shades and other items to protect from the harsh Australian sun,"" the company said, adding that it could not comment further due to the ongoing legal case.
Court documents show Eminem trademarked the name Slim Shady in the US in 1999 with the release of the eponymous album. However, he only filed a trademark for the Slim Shady name in Australia in January 2025.
Eminem shot into fame in 2000 with the release of his hit single The Real Slim Shady, which earned him a Grammy for best rap solo performance.
His lawyers said the name has become ""distinctive and famous"" and exclusively associated with his rap career.
Sydney intellectual property legal specialist firm Meyer West IP is listed as Swim Shady's legal representative.
Last year, an Australian court overturned an earlier ruling that US pop star Katy Perry infringed on the trademark of Australian designer Katie Perry.
The Australian designer sold clothes under her birth name and had accused the California Girls singer of trademark infringement when she sold merchandise during her 2014 Australian tour.
Katie Perry compared the legal clash at the time to a David and Goliath showdown."

Over the years, handouts have taken different forms in the hotly contested political landscape of the world's largest democracy. Voters have been lured with everything from television sets to bicycles and sometimes even gold ornaments - blurring the fine line between welfare economics and pre-poll populism.
In recent years, cash transfers, especially directed towards women, have become a popular election-winning strategy for political parties of all stripes.
A sweeping victory last week in the eastern state of Bihar - India's poorest state - for an alliance led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is being credited in part to a 10,000 rupee ($112; £85.18) cash handout to the state's women. A record number of women turned out to vote in the election.
Similar women-oriented financial support schemes were launched by Modi's party in other states like Maharashtra ahead of polls last year. Opposition parties have also promised similar schemes in some states ahead of elections.
Economists like Jean Drèze have argued in favour of such giveaways. He says that while distinguishing between ""useful"" and ""wasteful"" handouts is important, it is only by extracting promises during elections that the poor in India get anything at all from their political representatives.
On the other hand, despite his party's own track record on the issue, Modi has in the past warned of the dangers of ""revdi culture"" - likening election giveaways to the frivolous distribution of sweets. India's top court had also sought to curb the distribution of such ""irrational freebies"" during elections back in 2023.
While there is broad agreement on the need for targeted subsidies to challenge the use of handouts as electoral bait, Indian elections are increasingly dominated by unaffordable, poll-driven freebie economics that states can ill afford.
According to research from brokerage Emkay Global, Bihar is facing considerable fiscal pressure, with the deficit or gap between what the state earns and spends at 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP).
Despite this, the state announced pre-election schemes amounting to 4% of GDP, more than its capital outlay - money that could have been spent in job-creating, long-term assets that would have aided the state's development.
It is just one example in a litany of states practising indiscriminate election populism, according to Emkay Global.
""Even good [fiscally prudent] states are now in the grip of freebie economics,"" the brokerage said, as a result of which the 3% fiscal deficit to GDP ceiling that has been mandated for states, to curb non-budgeted spending, is now actually the floor.
Some estimates suggest that 21 of India's 29 states have crossed this 3% deficit target, with disproportionate costs imposed by election-driven spending being one of the reasons.
The fact that such populism is unsustainable is illustrated by the Bharatiya Janata Party-led alliance's Ladki Bahin (Beloved Sister) financial assistance scheme, which led to a 0.4% jump in Maharashtra state's deficit, according to Emkay Global. It forced the government to roll back some of the promises once the polls were over.
India's central bank has also flagged the rising burden of such subsidies on state-level debt as a key emerging concern.
According to the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), while overall debt of Indian states declined to about 28.5% of GDP by March 2024 compared with the levels seen over the past decade, it remains well above the 20% recommended threshold, with new pressures emerging in the form of an increasing subsidy burden.
""An area of incipient stress is the sharp rise in expenditure on subsidies, driven by farm loan waivers, free/subsidised services (like electricity to agriculture and households, transport, gas cylinder) and cash transfers to farmers, youth and women,"" the RBI said in its 2024-25 report on state finances.
""States need to contain and rationalise their subsidy outgoes, so that such spending does not crowd out more productive expenditure.""
This warning comes as the private sector continues to hold back on investment in new job-creating factories, and the government, forced to slow its own capital spending on infrastructure, turns instead to tax cuts and giveaways to spur middle-class consumption.
But with freebies seeing such success in Bihar - and more state elections looming - that warning is unlikely to be heeded.
""This [Bihar] election outcome reinforces the freebie wave that has swept states in the last two years, and with Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and crucially, West Bengal going to polls next year, one can expect this race to the bottom to continue,"" Emkay Global economists Medhavi Arora and Harshal Patel said in their note.

2025-11-18 15:28:49,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2l1zxekp3o,Is phubbing ruining your relationship? Here's how to fix it,"We all know our phones aren't great for our relationships, but that doesn't stop us reaching for them dozens of times a day.
That's how so called phubbing - unintentionally snubbing someone in favour of your phone -creeps into everyday moments.
This can impact your relationship by making partners feel ignored and parental phone use can really affect children from weakening bonds with younger kids and denting self-esteem in older ones.
Rather than criticising yourself about your lack of self-control, focusing on being more intentional about when we pick up our devices can be more effective, according to one psychologist.
Dr Kaitlyn Regehr, Associate Professor at University College London suggests one simple way to stop you picking up your phone mindlessly when you're with someone else.
Every time you reach for your phone, tell the other person why you're doing it, and when you're done, put it down and re-engage.
It sounds almost too easy, but Dr Regehr tells Woman's Hour that this small shift can help change our behaviour as we often check messages, swipe notifications or ""Just quickly look something up"" without thinking.
What matters is being transparent, so if a message pops up that you need to check, you should tell the person or people you are with: ""I just need to reply to this, then you'll have my attention again.""
By naming it - ""I need to check my train times"" or ""I'm replying to my mum"" - you interrupt the automatic habit of checking your phone and it also signals to the person beside you that they still matter.
""It stops the other person feeling ignored,"" Dr Regehr says.
""And it keeps you accountable, because you're less likely to drift into other apps or endless scrolling.""
Doing this could help improve your relationships too.
Dr Claire Hart, Associate Professor of Psychology at the University of Southampton, led a study which involved speaking to 196 people about their relationships and phone use. Overall the results showed that the more you feel you're being phubbed, the worse your relationship tends to be.
""Not everyone reacts in the same way,"" Dr Hart says. ""It depends on personality, but once one person feels ignored, it can trigger retaliation.
""They pick up their own phone, and that's when it becomes a dangerous spiral as each partner feels rejected or less valued than whatever's on the screen.""
Every time you are phubbed you lose connection and once you've left a shared moment to look at a screen, it can take a while to get back to what was going on before."

Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle and his counterpart in the House of Lords, Lord McFall, have circulated a new ""espionage alert"" issued by the security services.
The MI5 alert identifies two LinkedIn profiles, which it says are used on behalf of the Chinese Ministry of State Security (MSS).
It says they act as ""civilian recruitment head-hunters"", targeting individuals working in British politics to solicit ""insider insights"".
Writing to MPs, Sir Lindsay said Chinese state actors were ""relentless"" in trying to ""interfere with our processes and influence activity at Parliament"".
He said the Chinese MSS was ""actively reaching out to individuals in our community"", and that they wanted to ""collect information and lay the groundwork for long-term relationships, using professional networking sites, recruitment agents and consultants acting on their behalf"".
The alert from MI5 says ""false personas"" approach targets to ""work as freelance consultants authoring geopolitical reports"".
Other elements of espionage described in the MI5 alert include all-expenses paid trips to China, and payment for information through cash or cryptocurrency.
Targets are said to include ""Parliament staff, economists, think tank employees, geo-political consultants and those working alongside [the government] including MPs and members of the House of Lords"".
Former Conservative Party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the alert showed China was taking an ""aggressive position"" that ""blows a hole through all of that ridiculous nonsense"" about whether or not China was a threat to UK national security.
""We have to be much, much more vigilant,"" he told BBC News.
""Why is the government so unable to call China what it is, which is a persistent, continuing threat to Britain's national security.
""That is clear to every single member of the public… but somehow the government seems to think it isn't that clear."""

Exports to India's largest foreign market had dropped sharply last month after 50% US tariffs on India - including a 25% penalty for buying Russian oil - kicked in on 27 August.
The improved data came as Indian state-run oil firms agreed to import more annual liquified petroleum gas (LPG) from the US and Trump exempted many farm goods from reciprocal tariffs that could benefit India.
Trade deal negotiations between the two countries are under way, with an Indian official saying that key aspects of the deal were nearing closure.
The jump in exports to the US came even as India's overall goods exports fell 11.8% year-on-year in October, with 15 of its top 20 markets seeing a decline in bilateral trade.
""Tariff-exempt sectors such as smartphones and pharmaceuticals may have performed better - though this remains a tentative assumption,"" said Ajay Srivastava of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI), a Delhi-based think tank, commenting on the latest trade numbers.
""Despite the October rebound, India's shipments to the US have dropped nearly 28.4% between May and October, erasing more than $2.5bn in monthly export value,"" Mr Srivastava added.
But trade tensions between the two countries appear to be gradually letting up after months of uncertainty.
On Monday, India said it had concluded a first-ever major deal that will see its state-run oil companies sourcing some 10% of the country's annual LPG needs from the US.
Petroleum Minister Hardeep Singh Puri described the decision as a ""historic development"" and said the world's largest and fastest growing LPG market has now opened up to the United States.
The Trump administration has been urging Delhi to ramp up its purchase of US petroleum products and reduce its dependency on Russian oil.
India became one of the biggest markets for Russian oil as Western nations imposed sanctions on Moscow after the Ukraine war started in 2022.
Last year, India bought $52.7bn of Russian crude - 37% of its oil bill - but Trump has reiterated time and again, that the country has agreed to reduce its purchases, something India has not officially confirmed.
Delhi is walking a diplomatic tightrope on energy imports as Russian President Vladimir Putin prepares to visit Delhi early next month to finalise several agreements and projects, local reports say.
Yet trade talks between India and the US - stalled for months over Delhi's refusal to cut Russian oil imports - now appear to be moving quickly despite this.
On Monday, a senior government official told The Hindu newspaper that the first phase of the trade deal is ""more or less near closure"".
India is also set to benefit from the US's decision to roll back reciprocal tariffs on certain agricultural products such as tea, coffee and spices - a move that, analysts say, would effectively exempt about $1bn worth of India's agricultural exports to the US from duties.

But Oliver Edwards, a beef and sheep farmer on Exmoor, told the BBC he was concerned that reintroducing a predatory species would have ""a detrimental effect on the animals and bird life that live here already"".
""They say wildcats live on voles. Well, voles are feeding my barn owls so if you reduce the vole population you are having an effect on the barn owls,"" he explained.
He added that there needed to be wider consultation with farmers and landowners about the best areas to reintroduce the wildcats.
European wildcats – historically also known as woodcats – were once widespread in Great Britain until human persecution and the loss of woodland and rough grass habitats saw them disappear from England and Wales.
Today, the UK's only remaining wildcat population lives in the Highlands of Scotland but, despite being given protected status in 1988, they are now classed as critically endangered and at risk of UK extinction, with as few as 115 remaining in the wild.
Cath Jeffs, the South West Wildcat Project lead for Devon Wildlife Trust, said the team would continue to work closely with locals to deal with any concerns or issues raised over the phased reintroduction and that specific locations had yet to be decided.
She pointed out that most measures taken to stop predators like foxes from targeting poultry or gamebirds would work for wildcats.
She added that it was unlikely there would be a population explosion as wildcats live in low density numbers over wider areas and they would be closely monitored and managed.
""We are absolutely committed to making this happen, but in the right way and at the right time,"" she added.
The south west of England has been identified as a prime site for reintroduction because of the woodland cover it offers across mid-Devon, connected by other habitats that suit wildcats.
But some critics have suggested the area is more populated than parts of the Highlands where they have been reintroduced before.
They said that could lead to the wildcats breeding with feral domestic cats, with such interbreeding – also known as hybridisation - undermining the whole idea of bringing back the species.
Tim Bonner, chief executive of the Countryside Alliance, said that the organisation was not opposed to ""properly planned and managed reintroduction"".
But he said there were concerns about the ability to sustain a ""genetically pure"" population of wildcat because of the threat of hybridisation.
""Reintroducing wildcats in the south-west without addressing this issue would seem to be doomed to failure,"" he said.
A spokeswoman for the Devon Wildlife Trust said they would tackle the threat of hybridisation by working with local welfare organisations to support a neutering programme for feral and domestic cats in areas where wildcats were introduced."
2025-11-18 15:28:30,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g311jn1m9o,A Chinese firm bought an insurer for CIA agents - part of Beijing's trillion dollar spending spree,"Since 2018, the United States has been tightening its laws to prevent its rivals from buying into its sensitive sectors – blocking investments in everything from semiconductors to telecommunications.
But the rules weren't always so strict.
In 2016, Jeff Stein, a veteran journalist covering the US intelligence community, got a tip-off: a small insurance company that specialised in selling liability insurance to FBI and CIA agents had been sold to a Chinese entity.
""Someone with direct knowledge called me up and said, 'Do you know that the insurance company that insures intelligence personnel is owned by the Chinese?'"" he remembers. ""I was astonished!""
In 2015, the insurer, Wright USA, had been quietly purchased by Fosun Group, a private company believed to have very close connections with China's leadership.
US concerns became immediately clear: Wright USA was privy to the personal details of many of America's top secret service agents and intelligence officials. No one in the US knew who might have access to that information now the insurer and its parent, Ironshore, were Chinese-owned.
Wright USA wasn't an isolated case.
The BBC has exclusive early access to new data that shows how Chinese state money has been flowing into wealthy countries, buying up assets in the US, Europe, the Middle East and Australia.
In the past couple of decades China has become the world's biggest overseas investor, giving it the potential to dominate sensitive industries, secrets and key technologies. Beijing considers the details of its foreign spending overseas – how much money it's spending and where - to be a state secret.
But on the terms of the Wright USA sale, Stein says: ""There was nothing illegal about it; it was in the open, so to speak. But because everything's intertwined so closely in Beijing, you're essentially giving that [information] up to Chinese intelligence.""
The Chinese government was involved in the deal: fresh data seen by the BBC reveals that four Chinese state banks had provided a $1.2bn (£912m) loan, routed through the Cayman Islands, to allow Fosun to buy Wright USA.
Stein's story ran in Newsweek magazine. And there was a swift reaction in Washington: triggering an inquiry by the branch of the US Treasury that screens investments, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS). Shortly after, the company was sold again - back to Americans. It's unclear who ordered that sale.
Fosun and Starr Wright USA, the company that now owns Wright USA, did not respond to a BBC request for comment.
High-level US intelligence sources confirm the Wright USA sale was one of the cases that led the first Trump administration to tighten its investment laws in 2018.
Very few could have understood at the time that this Chinese state-backed spending appears to have been part of a much bigger strategy carried out by Beijing to invest and buy assets in every continent.

""For many years, we assumed that virtually all of China's money flows were going to developing countries,"" says Brad Parks, executive director of AidData. ""And so, it came as a great surprise to us when we realised that actually there were hundreds of billions of dollars going into places like the US, the UK and Germany, happening right underneath our noses.""
AidData is a research lab based in Virginia that specialises in tracking how governments spend their money outside their borders.  It's based at William & Mary, one of America's oldest universities and it gets its funding from governments and charitable organisations around the world. For the past 12 years, AidData has had a major focus on China.
A four-year effort involving 120 researchers has led to the first known effort to tally all of China's state-backed investments around the world. The group's entire dataset is available open source although the BBC was given exclusive advance access.
AidData's key discovery: since 2000, Beijing has spent $2.1 trillion outside its borders, with a roughly equal split between developing and wealthy countries.

""China has a kind of financial system that the world has never seen,"" says Victor Shih, director of the 21st Century China Centre at University of California San Diego. China has the largest banking system in the world – larger than the US, Europe and Japan put together, he adds.
That size, along with the amount of control Beijing exerts over state banks, gives it unique capabilities.
""The government controls interest rates and directs where the credit goes,"" Mr Shih says. ""This is only possible with very strict capital control, which no other country could have on a sustainable basis.""
Some of the investments in wealthy economies appear to have been made in order to generate a healthy return. Others fall in line with Beijing's strategic objectives, set out a decade ago in a major government initiative called Made in China 2025.
In it the Chinese authorities outlined a clear plan to dominate 10 cutting-edge industries, like robotics, electric vehicles and semiconductors by this year.
Beijing wanted to fund big investments abroad so key technologies could be brought back to China.
Global alarm at the plan led China to drop public mention of it, but Victor Shih says it ""stayed very much alive"" as a guiding strategy.
""There are all kinds of plans still being published,"" he says, ""including an artificial intelligence plan and a smart manufacturing plan. However, the mother of all plans is the 15th five-year plan.""
At a key meeting of the Communist Party last month, China's leaders  set the goal of accelerating ""high-level scientific and technological self-reliance and self-improvement"" until 2030.
AidData's new database highlights state-backed spending overseas that matches the 10 sectors targeted in 2015. The BBC's earlier reporting detailed how the Chinese government bankrolled the purchase of a UK semiconductor company.
The United States, the UK and many other major economies have tightened their investment screening mechanisms after each country appears to have been caught off-guard by deals like the sale of the insurer, Wright USA.
AidData's Brad Parks says wealthy governments didn't realise at first that Chinese investments in each country were part of Beijing's larger strategy.
""At first blush, they thought it was just a lot of individual initiative from Chinese companies,"" he says. ""I think what they've learned over time is that actually Beijing's party state is behind the scenes writing the cheques to make this happen.""
However, it must be underlined that such investments and purchases are legal, even if they are sometimes obscured within shell companies or routed through offshore accounts.
""The Chinese government has always required Chinese enterprises operating overseas to strictly comply with local laws and regulations, and has consistently supported them in conducting international co-operation based on mutual benefit,"" the Chinese embassy in London told the BBC.
""Chinese companies not only provide quality products and services to people around the world, but also contribute actively to local economic growth, social development and job creation.""
China's spending patterns are changing, the AidData database shows, with Beijing's state money flowing to countries that have decided to welcome Chinese investment.
In the Netherlands there's been debate around Nexperia, a troubled Chinese-owned semiconductor company.
It shows up in the AidData database too – Chinese state banks loaned $800m to help a Chinese consortium acquire Nexperia in 2017. Two years later, the ownership passed to another Chinese company - Wingtech.
Nexperia's strategic value was highlighted when the Dutch authorities took control of the company's operations in September -  in part, the Dutch government said, over concerns that Nexperia's technology was at risk of being transferred to other parts of the larger Wingtech company.
That bold move had resulted in Nexperia effectively being cut into two – separating Dutch operations from its Chinese manufacturing.
Nexperia confirmed to the BBC that its Chinese business had stopped operating within Nexperia's governance framework and was ignoring instructions.
The company said it welcomed China's commitment to resuming exports of its critical chips to global markets.
Xiaoxue Martin, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in The Hague, says many in the Netherlands were surprised at how the government handled the case, since they've always managed their relationship with China carefully in the past.
""We're a country that has always done very well with open trade, free trade. And this is really the merchant side of Dutch policy,"" she says. ""Only recently we found that actually, hold on - geopolitics makes it necessary to have more industrial policy, to have this investment screening, when in the past there wasn't that much attention for this.""
Xiaoxue Martin is clear – it's easy to go too far down the path of fearing what could happen as a result of doing so much business with a superpower like China.
""There's a danger of making it seem as if China is this monolith, that they all want the same thing, and that they're all out to get Europe, and to get the United States, when obviously that's not the case,"" she says.
""Most companies, especially if they're private, they just want to make money. They want to be treated as a normal company. They don't want to have this negative reception that they're getting in Europe.""
If China is so far ahead of its rivals in its plans to buy into sensitive sectors, does that mean the race to dominate these arenas is already over?
""No! There's gonna be multiple laps,"" maintains Brad Parks. ""There are many Chinese companies that are still trying to make these types of acquisitions. The difference is, now they're facing higher levels of scrutiny to vet these inbound sources of foreign capital.
""So China makes its move. China is not the follower any more, it is the leader. It is the pace setter. But what I'm anticipating is that many G7 countries are going to move from the back foot to the front foot.
""They're going to move from defence to offence."""
2025-11-18 15:28:12,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gw119ynlxo,Total faces war crimes allegations over Mozambique massacre,"A French energy company is facing war crimes allegations, which it denies, over a massacre near its multi-billon dollar international gas project in northern Mozambique in 2021.
In a complaint filed with French prosecutors, a human rights group accused TotalEnergies of complicity in war crimes, including the torture and execution of dozens of civilians held by local security forces in a cluster of shipping containers at its facility.
Total has always denied responsibility for the actions of government troops and related security forces who were involved in guarding the Afungi peninsula gas refinery development.
It was the biggest foreign investment project in Africa at the time.
The complaint was filed by the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR), a human rights group.
""Companies and their executives are not neutral actors when they operate in conflict zones. If they enable or fuel crimes, they might be complicit and should be held accountable,"" said Clara Gonzales, the ECCHR's co-programme director for business and human rights.
The massacre by Mozambican forces took place in resource-rich Cabo Delgado province, where government troops were battling violent Islamist militants, linked to the Islamic State group, with a gruesome reputation for beheading victims.
In March 2021, Islamists attacked the besieged town of Palma, where they killed or  kidnapped 1,563 civilians living next to TotalEnergies gas plant on Mozambique's remote northern Afungi peninsula, according to Alex Perry.
The investigative journalist first documented the Palma death toll, and the subsequent reprisal massacre at the entrance to Total's compound, for Politico in 2024.
Perry called it the ""bloodiest disaster in oil and gas history"".
Locals who sought help from the forces at the Total facility were accused of aiding the insurgents. Men were separated from the group by force and held in shipping containers. The exact number of civilians subsequently killed by Mozambican  forces providing security for Total is not clear. Perry identified 97 victims but estimates the true figure could be double that.
""Most people have never heard about any of this, in part because Total has acknowledged none of it. Today is a victory for truth, and accountability,"" Perry told the BBC.
The BBC has contacted TotalEnergies for comment.
The British government initially offered financial guarantees for UK companies seeking to take part in what was heralded as an unprecedented opportunity for economic development in Mozambique.
But after suspending support following the bloodshed in Palma, Britain is now being urged to walk away by environmental campaigners, who say the gravity of the allegations against Total must be a ""red line"" for the financial backers of its liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Mozambique.
Total continued to ""demonstrate that it has learned nothing from the past: it just announced the lifting of the force majeure on its gas project, despite the dramatic security and humanitarian situation"", Lorette Philippot from Friends of the Earth France said.
The UK and Dutch governments must ""refuse to renew their financial support and withdraw from Mozambique LNG"", she added, like French banks Société Générale and Crédit Agricole.
Supporters of TotalEnergies' determination to proceed with the vast project in Cabo Delgado say it is a bold investment that could bring huge rewards to a neglected region of Africa.
But critics say it is an environmental, ethical and financial disaster. They draw links between Total's actions and struggles and those of another giant French company, Lafarge, which went on trial in France this month, along with eight former employees, over allegations that it paid jihadist groups in Syria to keep a cement plant there in operation."

2025-11-18 15:28:14,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmv877746o,Parasocial is Cambridge Dictionary Word of the Year,"""Parasocial"" is the Cambridge Dictionary's Word of the Year, defined as a relationship felt by someone between themselves and a famous person they do not know.
Its examples include the parasocial interest displayed by fans when singer Taylor Swift and American footballer Travis Kelce announced their engagement.
The term dates back to 1956, when American sociologists observed TV viewers engaging in ""para-social"" relationships with on-screen personalities.
Chief editor Colin McIntosh said it had recently been used to describe ""a type of relationship, between a person and a non-person, for example a celebrity"".
""It was originally coined as an academic word and was confined to the academic sphere for quite a long time,"" he added.
""It's only fairly recently that it's made a shift into popular language and it's one of those words that have been influenced by social media.""
Other examples given by the dictionary included Lily Allen's breakup album West End Girl, which leaned into a parasocial interest in her love life, and the emergence of parasocial relationships with AI bots, which saw people treat them as a confidant, friend or romantic partner.
The confessional nature of podcast hosts have been said to replace real friends and to catalyse parasocial relationships.
The dictionary saw a surge in people looking up the word after the Youtube star IShowSpeed blocked an obsessive fan as his ""number 1 parasocial"".
The word was first coined by University of Chicago sociologists Donald Horton and Richard Wohl, who observed television viewers engaged in ""para-social"" relationships with on-screen personalities, resembling those they formed with ""real"" family and friends.
They noted how the rapidly expanding medium of television brought the faces of actors directly into viewers' homes, making them fixtures in people's lives.
Senior editor Jessica Rundell said: ""We're not here to judge what's a good word, what's a bad word and whether it's valid - it's more if it stands the test of time and if people are using it all over place.""
New entrants to the Cambridge Dictionary included skibidi, delulu and tradwife.

2025-11-18 15:28:35,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1d0vekq12ro,Brazil creates new Indigenous territories during protest-hit COP30,"COP30 host Brazil has created 10 new Indigenous territories, with the climate summit hit by protests in recent days.
The designation means the areas, including one in part of the Amazon, will have their culture and environment protected under Brazilian law - though this is not always enforced.
The move follows similar actions from President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, whose government recognised Indigenous possession of 11 territories last year. The latest measure will be formalised through a presidential decree.
It comes as thousands have protested at the UN's annual climate conference, with some carrying signs reading ""demarcation now"".
Earlier last week, demonstrators - some of whom were from Indigenous groups - carrying signs that read ""our forests are not for sale"" broke into the summit and tussled with security.
Security around the conference has since increased noticeably, with more armed soldiers and police at the entrance. Lots of Indigenous groups do not have accreditation to go inside.
More than 200 human rights groups wrote to UN officials on Monday criticising the enhanced security, saying it ""contributes to an increasing global trend towards the silencing of dissent, militarised response to protest, and marginalisation of those defending land and the environment"".
Past recognition of Indigenous reserves banned mining and logging, as well as restricting commercial farming, in the areas they covered to prevent deforestation.
Expanding the total area considered Indigenous territory could prevent up to 20% of additional deforestation and reduce carbon emissions by 26% by 2030, according to a study by the Articulation of Indigenous Peoples of Brazil, the Amazon Environmental Research Institute and the Indigenous Climate Change Committee.
The new protected areas span hundreds of thousands of hectares and are inhabited by thousands of people from the Mura, Tupinambá de Olivença, Pataxó, Guarani-Kaiowá, Munduruku, Pankará, and Guarani-Mbya indigenous peoples.
One area overlaps more than 78% with the Amazon National Park, part of the bio-diverse rainforest which plays a crucial role in regulating the global climate and storing carbon.
The Brazilian government's announcement came on Indigenous Peoples' Day at COP30 on Monday.
Until the left-wing Lula re-entered office, no new Indigenous lands had been declared since 2018, it said.
Under his far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who promoted mining on Indigenous lands, the protections afforded to them were frequently not enforced.
Lula's government has previously taken action to drive out illegal miners from indigenous lands.
Currently, Indigenous lands encompass 117.4 million hectares - roughly equivalent to the size of Colombia, or around 13.8% of Brazil's territory.
Hundreds of Indigenous groups live in Brazil, according to the country's census.
The Amazon rainforest is already at risk of a renewed surge in deforestation as efforts grow to overturn a key ban to protect it. Thick and healthy forestry helps pull carbon out of the atmosphere.
Carbon released through the burning of fossil fuels has contributed to climate change.
Countries are gathering at COP30 in an effort to reach agreements on how to try to limit global average temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels and keep them ""well below"" 2C.
The UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says a large body of scientific evidence shows that warming of 2C or more would bring serious consequences, including extreme heat, higher sea levels and threats to food security."
2025-11-18 15:28:46,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyv8rrjygrvo,What now for Queen's playhouse after Andrew evicted from Royal Lodge?,"Once described as the ""most glamorous Wendy house ever"", Y Bwthyn Bach became a memorable childhood feature for generations of the Royal Family.
The miniature two-storey thatched cottage was gifted to a young Princess Elizabeth in 1932 by the people of Wales.
It was installed in the grounds of her family's then home, Royal Lodge in Windsor, and has remained there ever since, most recently in the care of Andrew Mountbatten Windsor, who has lived in the mansion since 2004.
But with the late Queen's third child stripped of his titles and evicted from the royal residence, what does the future hold for the cottage - and could it even be returned to Wales?
Y Bwthyn Bach – Welsh for The Little Cottage – was built in Cardiff and presented to Princess Elizabeth's parents, the then Duke and Duchess of York, for their daughter's sixth birthday.
Designed by architect Edmund Willmott, the cottage was built by Welsh craftsmen from materials left over from the construction of Llandough Hospital in Vale of Glamorgan, which opened in 1933.
It was a carefully planned miniature version of a real-life house, with four 5ft-high rooms – two upstairs and two downstairs.
It even included its own working telephone, electric cooker, fridge and running water in the kitchen, luxuries even for real homes in the 1930s.
""It's called a cottage but it was more like a replica of a very comfortable house,"" said historian Dr Elin Jones.
""It's an enchanting place and I remember seeing pictures of it when I was a child, and seeing, at the time, Prince Charles and Princess Anne playing in what looked like a fantastic Wendy House,"" said Dr Jones.
At the time of the gift, Elizabeth's parents were the Duke and Duchess of York, before her father ascended to the throne as George VI, following his brother Edward VIII's abdication.
Custody of the cottage later passed to Andrew when he was Duke of York and he reportedly paid for its upkeep, while his daughters Beatrice and Eugenie were among the next generation of royals to enjoy it.
Princess Beatrice oversaw a refurbishment of the cottage and later described it as the ""most glamorous Wendy house ever"" in a BBC documentary celebrating Elizabeth II's Diamond Jubilee.
""Granny and her sister [Princess Margaret] played here growing up,"" she said at the time. ""We have been lucky enough to play here, and cousins and second cousins.""
But with the removal of Andrew's titles, the future of the cottage is unclear.
Buckingham Palace confirmed to the BBC that ownership of Y Bwthyn Bach currently sits with King Charles III.
""Both the Royal Family and the governments of England and Wales have other things to think about, which are rather more pressing and important than a child's plaything,"" said Dr Jones.
""But it could be argued that the best place for this little cottage… might be for it to come back to Wales and go to St Fagans as part of the history of our country.
""The house is an interesting expression of the loyalty felt by Welsh people towards the Royal family for centuries.""
But those ties are ""weakening, loosening, because of devolution and the current changes in society"", the historian said.
Dr Jones added: ""I think Y Bwthyn Bach is a fossil, really. It's historically interesting, you could argue that it is a part of Welsh history which might be better placed in a museum in Wales, like so many other relics of our past.""
Royal enthusiast Anne Daley, from Cardiff, hopes the cottage will continue to be used by younger members of the family rather than risk falling into disuse.
""It's just another cottage that's now empty – how many other are empty on that estate now?"" she said.
""What about the Prince of Wales and Catherine? I wonder if their children would play in it. It's only going to be forgotten about, dilapidated, unless Prince William lets his kids play there.""
If that were not the case, she too would like to see it return to Wales.
""It was a gift so it belongs to them,"" she said. ""I'm not sure really if you can ask for a gift back.
""But, historically, I'd love to see it, the public have never seen the inside.
""I would suggest bring it back to St Fagans museum and we can all have a look at it, even if you need to demolish it brick by brick and put it back together."""
2025-11-18 15:28:32,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17pj0gr75lo,'I hated that I looked Asian': KPop Demon Hunters star on her struggle for acceptance,"""I hated that I looked Asian, that I didn't have blue eyes and blonde hair, because that's what was beautiful at the time,"" says Arden Cho, the actress who voiced Rumi, star of Netflix's chart-topping animated film, KPop Demon Hunters.
Speaking to the BBC World Service for the Global Women series, Cho, 40, is describing her childhood in Texas, as the eldest daughter of Korean immigrant parents and her struggle for acceptance in American society.
In the film, which tells the story of a female K-Pop trio who must save the world from evil forces, Rumi has to come to terms with her identity as part human, part demon - and when Cho first read the script this resonated powerfully.
""Being born in America, feeling American but having people treat me like I'm not, trying to figure out my identity as an Asian-American, as a Korean-American, as a woman,"" she says.
These were all elements of her early life that mirrored Rumi's journey.
""I can honestly say that at different points in my life, I hated a lot of myself and I wanted to be someone else.
""As kids, what you see shapes who you become and I feel like I just didn't see enough people that look like me.""
When it launched on Netflix in June, KPop Demon Hunters registered 33 million views in just two weeks, and reached the top 10 of the Netflix charts in 93 countries. To star in the first Hollywood animated film set in Korea, with Korean leads, was for Cho ""a dream come true"" – but it has also made her a powerful role model for Asian-American children, of the kind that she lacked when she was young.
Cho says many Korean-Americans have told her it's ""such a refreshing moment"", making them proud for the first time of their dual heritage and culture.
""I feel like K-Pop really, truly, has paved the way. K-beauty has had such a big impact on Korea being loved. But I feel like this movie is the one that tipped it over the edge of, everybody wants to go to Korea, now,"" Cho says.
But the film's success was not guaranteed and Cho says she felt the team making it were ""sometimes facing an uphill battle"".
""I feel like it kind of sucks to say this, but any time there's an Asian-led project, people feel like it's a risk,"" she says.
So, when she took on the role, she made an effort to meet everyone working on the film in person, she says.
The film was released against the backdrop of increased immigration raids in the US as part of the Trump administration's mass deportation effort, which sparked protests in many states.
As an Asian-American living in the US ""it's heartbreaking and disappointing,"" says Cho. ""Immigrants have made America what it is.""
Korean news sources have estimated that up to 150,000 Korean immigrants without proper documentation, including adopted children, are among those who could be deported.
As an adult, Cho came to realise that the racism she had experienced when she was younger stemmed mainly from a lack of education, as people didn't know what it meant to be Korean or Asian.
""But now in this day and age, when I feel like the world and people should know better, it is beyond disappointing and sometimes I feel like we feel so hopeless,"" she says.
Because of this, it feels very special, she says, that KPop Demon Hunters could bring ""hope and joy and love to all these different communities"".
""Maybe that's why it's sort of like this movie of the summer, because we just needed some hope and something to unite us all together.""
The growth of AI is a major concern for the film industry, raising the possibility that in future it could be used to make a film like KPop Demon Hunters.
Cho says she is aware that AI is already being used to replicate actors' voices, but wants to ""have hope in humanity"" that people will still seek out art created by humans.
""Sure, I'm sure they're going to have AI actors and singers. I know they already exist. I know our voices are already being manipulated, but I hope people have some respect and want and love for something real.""
KPop Demon Hunters has also been dominating the global music charts, with seven tracks from its soundtrack featured on the Billboard Hot 100. It has its own fan art, and audiences around the world are demanding a sequel.
Cho tells us she wishes she could answer the question of whether that will happen - but both she and fans will have to wait for Netflix or Sony Pictures Entertainment, which made the film, to give it the green light.
""I know there's lots of murmurs, I've heard wonderful things,"" she says. ""So we shall see, and I think everyone in the world would riot if there wasn't."""
2025-11-18 15:28:32,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1j86xydjpro,Australian murderer sues for right to eat Vegemite behind bars,"A convicted murderer serving a life sentence in Australia is challenging a ban on prisoners consuming Vegemite - the polarising, salty spread that has become a national symbol.
State authorities say inmates may use the strong-smelling condiment to disguise contraband substances or brew alcohol behind bars.
But Andre McKechnie argues that the ban, in place in the state of Victoria since 2006, denies him the right to ""enjoy his culture as an Australian"", according to court documents seen by AFP and AP.
McKechnie was handed a life sentence for stabbing a property developer to death in Queensland in the 1990s. He served part of his sentence in Queensland before being transferred to Victoria.
In his lawsuit against Victoria's Department of Justice and Corrections, the agency managing the state's prisons, the 54-year-old said he wanted the Vegemite ban overturned.
He also wants prison authorities to declare that they ""failed to provide food adequate to maintain [his] wellbeing"".
The case is scheduled for trial next year, AP reported.
A much-loved breakfast spread for some, Vegemite has acquired controversial accolades since it first hit shop shelves in Australia in 1923.
The thick, brown condiment - made primarily from yeast extract - was invented in the Victorian capital of Melbourne more than a century ago as an alternative to the British spread Marmite.
In 2022, Melbourne declared the smell of Vegemite wafting from a factory in the city a ""significant"" aspect of the city's cultural heritage.
However, the condiment's polarising taste has landed it in the Disgusting Food Museum in Sweden - alongside natto, stinky tofu and monkey brains.
Vegemite sparked an international dispute in April this year when an Australian cafe owner in Canada was told to remove jars of the condiment from his shelves as it did not comply with local health regulations.
Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese intervened in the row, saying it was ""rather odd"" that Canada allowed the sale of Vegemite's ""rubbish"" rival product Marmite. The Canadian agency soon changed course and allowed the cafe owner to continue selling the spread."

2025-11-18 15:28:25,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kp6j5n68do,Off-duty US pilot who tried to crash plane midair to avoid new prison time,"A US pilot who tried to shut off a passenger plane's engines mid-flight will serve no additional prison time, a federal court has ruled.
The judge sentenced Joseph Emerson to credit for time served and supervised release for three years at a hearing in Portland, Oregon.
""Pilots are not perfect. They are human,"" Judge Amy Baggio said. ""They are people and all people need help sometimes.""
Emerson was off-duty during the October 2023 flight and blamed his behaviour on a mental breakdown caused by hallucinogenic mushrooms. He pleaded guilty in September to a single federal charge of interfering with a flight crew.
The former Alaska Airlines pilot had already pleaded no contest to state charges of endangering an aircraft and 83 counts of endangering another person. For those charges he received five years of probation and 50 days in jail.
The deal with federal prosecutors allowed him to avoid a sentence of up to 20 years behind bars.
Before the sentencing was announced, Emerson said he regretted the harm he had caused to society.
""I'm not a victim. I am here as a direct result of my actions,"" the 46-year-old told the court, according to the Associated Press. ""I can tell you that this very tragic event has forced me to grow as an individual.""
He hugged his lawyers and shared a tearful embrace with his wife after the judge announced his sentence, the AP reported.
The flight on 22 October 2023 was on its way from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco, California, with 80 passengers aboard. It was diverted to Portland, Oregon after the incident.
One pilot cited in the criminal complaint said he had to wrestle with Emerson until he stopped resisting. The entire incident lasted about 90 seconds.
After being subdued, Emerson said to flight attendants: ""You need to cuff me right now or it's going to be bad"" and later tried to reach for the emergency exit handle during the plane's descent.
One flight attendant told investigators they had observed Emerson saying ""I messed everything up"" and that he ""tried to kill everybody"".
Emerson had argued that that the drugs made him unaware of his actions at the time, that he had been grieving the death of a friend and that he did not intend to harm passengers.
He added that he had not slept for about 40 hours before the flight and felt he needed to ""wake up"".
""I had no intention of crashing an actual airplane,"" Emerson told CBS News. ""I wanted to wake up.""
Emerson's lawyers had argued that no prison time was warranted because he had been ""already adequately punished"".
He lost his licence to fly after his arrest and is now working part-time as a pressure washer, according to The Oregonian newspaper.
He has also paid $60,000 (£46,000) in restitution and is visiting schools to become a substance abuse counsellor.
He and his wife have also started the group Clear Skies Ahead, which intends to bring attention to mental health struggles among pilots."
2025-11-18 15:28:33,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn0gdzrklr7o,US House expected to approve resolution to release Epstein files,"The US House of Representatives is expected to approve a measure that would compel the justice department to release the ""Epstein files"": documents that were amassed during investigations into late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
House Speaker Mike Johnson said he expected a ""large vote tally"" when the measure came to the floor of the Republican-led chamber on Tuesday, after President Donald Trump called on Republican lawmakers to approve it.
But the files may not be released soon, and it is unclear if some will be held back. After the House, the measure must also be approved by the Senate.
Survivors of Epstein's abuse are also due to appear on Capitol Hill on Tuesday in support of the measure.
On Monday evening, the group World Without Exploitation projected images of some survivors onto buildings throughout Washington, all less than a mile from Capitol Hill, with the message: ""Congress, release all of the files.""
Members of both parties who are calling for the release of the files believe that the information could implicate powerful figures in Epstein's crimes.
At various stages over the years, other Epstein-related materials have been put into the public domain. Last week, thousands of documents belonging to Epstein's estate were released by the House Oversight Committee, mostly emails.
These mention Trump and other high-profile individuals who were in Epstein's orbit, without implying any wrongdoing by those individuals.
Trump has maintained he did not commit any wrongdoing and that he ended his friendship with Epstein long before Epstein was first arrested.
On the campaign trail last year, Trump supported the release of the files, but moved away from that position once in office, provoking frustration from his supporters. The justice department put out a limited batch of documents in February and later said there would be no more releases.
Lawmakers from both parties then began working on a resolution to force the release of all the files. Last week, at the end of the 43-day federal shutdown, Johnson swore in the newest House member, who immediately signed onto the petition to consider the resolution, pushing it over the threshold needed for a vote.
Trump, who had put pressure on fellow Republicans to reject the resolution, performed a U-turn on Sunday by saying he would support it after all.
Speaking to reporters the following evening, he confirmed that he would also sign the resolution into law, assuming it met the approval of both chambers of Congress.
""Sure I would,"" he said. ""Let the Senate look at it, let anybody look at it. But don't talk about it too much."" That was because, Trump said, the issue was taking attention away from his administration's accomplishments.
""We've done a great job and I hate to see that deflect from the great job we've done,"" he said.
Representative Robert Garcia, the top Democrat on the House Oversight Committee that has been investigating the Epstein files, said Trump did not need to wait for the resolution to pass the House and then Senate.
""Let's be crystal clear: Trump has the power to release all the files today,"" he said in a statement on Monday in which he accused Trump of wanting ""to deflect and slow down our investigation.""
Representative Thomas Massie, a Republican who drew Trump's ire by pushing for the release, told CNN he was ""a little bit suspicious of this sudden turn of events"" but believed the total number of votes supporting the resolution on Tuesday would be ""very big"".
""We're worried that maybe they'll try to muck it up in the Senate,"" he added, referring to the possibility that the Republican-dominated upper chamber would change the resolution once that chamber took it up.
Speaker Johnson said on Monday he had issues with how the measure had been drafted and took ""some comfort"" that the Senate would ""be able to correct some of those concerns that we have, the protection of victims and whistle-blowers and all the rest"".
Changing the measure could slow passage in the Senate. More time could then be required to reconcile the two chambers' different measures into one final version for Trump to sign.
Attorney General Pam Bondi last week said the justice department was beginning federal investigations into former President Bill Clinton, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, and others who were mentioned in documents from the Epstein estate that the House Oversight Committee recently released.
The House resolution currently says Bondi can withhold documents that ""would jeopardise an active federal investigation or ongoing prosecution""."
2025-11-18 15:28:51,https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77z2l3yzl8o,Reselling tickets above face value to be banned by government,"Reselling tickets to live events for a profit is to be banned by the government.
Ministers will announce the plan in a bid to tackle touts and resale sites, which often offer music, theatre, comedy and sport tickets at well above face value.
Restricting ticket touts was one of the Labour government's election pledges, as fans complained of massively inflated prices for resold tickets.
The decision comes a week after dozens of artists including Sam Fender, Dua Lipa and Coldplay urged Sir Keir Starmer to protect fans from exploitation.
A consultation on the changes had canvassed views on capping costs at up to 30% above the face value of a ticket.
But the government has decided to set the limit at the ""original cost"", or face value, while also promising to take measures to cap extra fees ""to prevent the price limit being undermined"".
The Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) suggested the move would end the ""business model of industrial-scale ticket touting"", and would make resale tickets £37 cheaper on average, saving fans collectively £112m per year.
Resale platforms will have a legal duty to monitor and enforce the new regulations.
""Ticket touting has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years,"" a DCMS statement said.
""Touts buy large volumes of tickets online, often using automated bots, before relisting them on resale platforms at hugely inflated prices. This has caused misery for millions of fans and damaged the live events industry.
""The new laws will stamp out this practice, improving access for genuine fans when tickets originally go on sale and ending rip-off pricing on the resale market.""
Housing Secretary Steve Reed told BBC Breakfast touts making profits at the expense of fans was ""such an important issue"" as it was ""hugely damaging to individuals having to pay through the nose for tickets"".
He stressed the government was ""committed to outlawing it"".
The move comes after the open letter by some of the biggest names in music.
The music stars urged the prime minister to stop the ""extortionate and pernicious"" websites that exploit fans.
Other signatories included consumer watchdog Which?, the Football Supporters' Association, and groups representing the music and theatre industries, venues and ticket retailers.
According to analysis by the Competition and Markets Authority, tickets currently sold on the resale market are typically marked up by more than 50%.
Investigations by Trading Standards have previously uncovered evidence of tickets being resold for up to six times their original cost.
Rocio Concha, director of policy and advocacy at Which?, said the change was ""great news for music and sports fans"", adding that the plan would ""rein in professional touts and put tickets back in the hands of real fans"".
She urged the government to ""show that the price cap is a priority by including the necessary legislation in the King's Speech"".
Ahead of the announcement, Ticketmaster's parent company Live Nation Entertainment said it already limits resale in the UK to face value prices and described the reported plan as ""another major step forward for fans"".
Resale sites like Viagogo and Stubhub have previously claimed that a price cap could push customers towards unregulated sites and social media, putting them at increased risk of fraud.
But Tom Kiehl, chief executive of UK Music, said a cap on secondary ticket prices was needed in order to protect both the industry and fans from ""exorbitant"" prices.
""The music industry itself is worth £8bn to the economy, and relies on that strong relationship between music fans and and the artist,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Tuesday.
""And what you have at the moment is the resale market, which isn't working.""

Speaking exclusively to BBC News, Sundar Pichai said while the growth of artificial intelligence (AI) investment had been an ""extraordinary moment"", there was some ""irrationality"" in the current AI boom.
It comes amid fears in Silicon Valley and beyond of a bubble as the value of AI tech companies has soared in recent months and companies spend big on the burgeoning industry.
Asked whether Google would be immune to the impact of the AI bubble bursting, Mr Pichai said the tech giant could weather that potential storm, but also issued a warning.
""I think no company is going to be immune, including us,"" he said.
In a wide-ranging exclusive interview at Google's California headquarters, he also addressed energy needs, slowing down climate targets, UK investment, the accuracy of his AI models, and the effect of the AI revolution on jobs.
The interview comes as scrutiny on the state of the AI market has never been more intense.
Alphabet shares have doubled in value in seven months to $3.5tn (£2.7tn) as markets have grown more confident in the search giant's ability to fend off the threat from ChatGPT owner OpenAI.
A particular focus is Alphabet's development of specialised superchips for AI that compete with Nvidia, run by Jensen Huang, which recently reached a world first $5tn valuation.
As valuations rise, some analysts have expressed scepticism about a complicated web of $1.4tn of deals being done around OpenAI, which is expected to have revenues this year of less than one thousandth of the planned investment.
It has raised fears stock markets are heading for a repeat of the dotcom boom and bust of the late 1990s. This saw the values of early internet companies surge amid a wave of optimism for what was then a new technology, before the bubble burst in early 2000 and many share prices collapsed.
This led to some companies going bust, resulting in job losses. A drop in share prices can also hit the value of people's savings including their pension funds.
In comments echoing those made by US Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan in 1996, warning of ""irrational exuberance"" in the market well ahead of the dotcom crash, Mr Pichai said the industry can ""overshoot"" in investment cycles like this.
""We can look back at the internet right now. There was clearly a lot of excess investment, but none of us would question whether the internet was profound,"" he said.
""I expect AI to be the same. So I think it's both rational and there are elements of irrationality through a moment like this.""
His comments follow a warning from Jamie Dimon, the boss of US bank JP Morgan, who told the BBC last month that investment in AI would pay off, but some of the money poured into the industry would ""probably be lost"".
But Mr Pichai said Google's unique model of owning its own ""full stack"" of technologies - from chips to YouTube data, to models and frontier science - meant it was in a better position to ride out any AI market turbulence.
The tech giant is also expanding its footprint in the UK. In September, Alphabet announced it was investing in UK artificial intelligence, committing £5bn to infrastructure and research over the next two years.
Mr Pichai said Alphabet will develop ""state of the art"" research work in the UK including at its key AI unit DeepMind, based in London.
For the first time, he said Google would ""over time"" take a step that is being pushed for in government to ""train our models"" in the UK - a move that cabinet ministers believe would cement the UK as the number three AI ""superpower"" after the US and China.
""We are committed to investing in the UK in a pretty significant way,"" Mr Pichai said.
However, he also warned about the ""immense"" energy needs of AI, which made up 1.5% of the world's electricity consumption last year, according to the International Energy Agency.
Mr Pichai said action was needed, including in the UK, to develop new sources of energy and scale up energy infrastructure.
""You don't want to constrain an economy based on energy, and I think that will have consequences,"" he said.
He also acknowledged that the intensive energy needs of its expanding AI venture meant there was slippage on the company's climate targets, but insisted Alphabet still had a target of achieving net zero by 2030 by investing in new energy technologies.
""The rate at which we were hoping to make progress will be impacted,"" he said.
AI will also affect work as we know it, Mr Pichai said, calling it ""the most profound technology"" humankind had worked on.
""We will have to work through societal disruptions,"" he said, adding that it would also ""create new opportunities"".
""It will evolve and transition certain jobs, and people will need to adapt,"" he said. Those who do adapt to AI ""will do better"".
""It doesn't matter whether you want to be a teacher [or] a doctor. All those professions will be around, but the people who will do well in each of those professions are people who learn how to use these tools.""

A new report by Physicians for Human Rights Israel (PHRI) alleges a practice of ""systematic killings and cover-ups"".
The report covers the period between 7 October 2023, when Hamas launched its deadly attack on Israel, sparking the latest conflict in Gaza, and 31 August 2025. It said fewer than 30 Palestinians died in Israeli custody in the 10 years prior.
The Israel Prison Service (IPS) told the BBC it ""operates in accordance with the law and under the supervision of official oversight bodies"".
It said it did not comment on figures or allegations from outside bodies.
""All inmates are held according to legal procedures, and their rights including access to medical care, hygiene, and adequate living conditions are upheld by professionally trained staff,"" the IPS added.
Since 7 October 2023, thousands of Palestinians have been detained across Gaza and the West Bank, many without charge.
PHRI said it had exposed a deeply concerning pattern of systematic human rights violations committed against Palestinians detained by Israel and classified as ""security prisoners"".
It said this was carried out as part of an official policy implemented by Israeli authorities since the war began.
Israeli authorities have stopped providing information about Palestinians in custody to the Red Cross and barred access to detention facilities.
PHRI said its report is based on official records and data cross-referenced with forensic reports, information from other human rights groups and efforts to locate specific people, as well as testimony from detainees, their families and lawyers.
Its authors say 52 of those who died were being held in military prisons while 42 died in civilian jails run by the IPS.
PHRI says the deaths were caused by physical violence, medical neglect, or both.
It singles out the policies of Itamar Ben-Gvir, Israel's right-wing national security minister and a key member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's coalition government.
PHRI said that, under Ben-Gvir's control, Israel's incarceration facilities holding Palestinians had ""effectively been transformed into sites of torture and abuse"".
It added daily physical violence was widespread, and that the deprivation of human rights and systematic torture had resulted in the deaths of dozens of Palestinians.
The highest number of deaths, 29, occurred at the Sde Teiman military prison in Southern Israel, near Gaza.
Five Israeli reservist soldiers have been charged with aggravated abuse and causing serious bodily harm, after a Palestinian prisoner was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the rectum with a sharp object at Sde Teiman in July 2024.
Footage emerged showing reserve soldiers taking a detainee aside and surrounding him with riot shields before he was allegedly attacked. The five reservists deny the charges and have not been named.
The alleged assault has divided the nation, with some right-wing politicians criticising a military police investigation and even some ""right to rape"" protests outside the jail.
The PHRI report accuses the Israeli authorities of trying to ""cover up"" and suppress investigations into Palestinian deaths and alleged abuses in custody.
In said that, in many cases, detainees' family members were not notified that their relatives had died and access to post-mortems was denied.
The report also said there had been a failure to prosecute Israeli prison staff and soldiers.
It examined a policy of what it called ""forced disappearance"", through which thousands of Palestinians have been detained without their families being notified or told where their relatives are being held.
PHRI said these ""grave violations of international law"" had made determining the full scope of Israel's prisoner policy and the fate of the many Palestinians taken into custody extremely difficult, if not impossible.
The group estimates the actual number of Palestinians killed could be higher than the number it has been able to document.
The IPS said ""the claims described do not reflect the conduct or procedures of the Israel Prison Service, and we are not aware of the incidents as presented"".
It continued: ""Every death in IPS custody is examined in accordance with established procedures and referred to the competent authorities as required.
""For reasons of privacy, security, and legal limitations, the IPS does not provide personal or statistical details regarding inmates, nor does it comment on individual cases.""
The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it operates ""in accordance with Israeli and international law"", and ""detains individuals in Gaza when there is reasonable suspicion of their involvement in terrorist activities"".
It said that, in some cases, criminal proceedings were then initiated, while in others ""preventive detention is enforced to remove individuals from the fighting, in full alignment with the Israeli law and the Geneva Conventions"".
""Detention orders and their duration are subject to judicial review as required by law,"" it added.
The IDF said it was aware of incidents of detainees dying in custody, but that these included people detained with existing illness or injury, adding each death was investigated by military police."

One of the two suspects had already been convicted in absentia of acts of sabotage in western Ukraine, Tusk told Poland's parliament, the Sejm.
On Monday, Tusk visited the scene of an explosion near Mika, south-east of Warsaw, which damaged the railway line leading to the Ukrainian border, calling it ""an unprecedented act of sabotage"".
Another incident further down the line near Pulawy forced a crowded train to stop suddenly and damage was found to overhead cables.
Polish authorities had initially said there was a very high chance that acts of sabotage had been ordered by a ""foreign service"".
But a spokesman for Poland's special services minister said on Tuesday that ""everything points to them being Russian special services"".
""The goal was to cause a rail catastrophe,"" Tusk told MPs.
The Polish prime minister said he would not disclose the names of the two suspects as this could complicate the operation, though he told parliament that one was living in Belarus and the other was a resident of eastern Ukraine.
Both suspects had crossed into Poland from Belarus during the autumn and had now returned there via the border crossing at Terespol in the far south-west of Belarus, close to the Ukrainian border, he added.
Poland is both a Nato and EU member state, and its railway network has become vital for moving for supplies of aid into Ukraine since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022."
